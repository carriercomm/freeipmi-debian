.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet-readings\fR
Do not output sensor reading values by default.  This option is
particularly useful if you want to use hostranged output across a
cluster and want to consolidate the output.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR "RECORD-IDS-LIST", \fB\-\-record\-ids\fR=\fB"RECORD-IDS-LIST"\fR
Specify sensors to show by record id.  Multiple record ids can be
separated by commas or spaces.  If both \fB\-\-record\-ids\fR and
\fB\-\-sensor\-types\fR are specified, \fB\-\-record\-ids\fR takes
precedence.  A special command line record id of "all", will indicate
all record ids should be shown (may be useful for overriding
configured defaults).
.TP
\fB\-R\fR "RECORD-IDS-LIST", \fB\-\-exclude\-record\-ids\fR=\fB"RECORD-IDS-LIST"\fR
Specify sensors to not show by record id.  Multiple record ids can be
separated by commas or spaces.  A special command line record id of
"none", will indicate no record ids should be excluded (may be useful
for overriding configured defaults).
.TP
\fB\-t\fR "SENSOR-TYPE-LIST", \fB\-\-sensor\-types\fR=\fISENSOR\-TYPE\-LIST\fR
Specify sensor types to show sensor outputs for.  Multiple types can
be separated by commas or spaces.  If both \fB\-\-record\-ids\fR and
\fB\-\-sensor\-types\fR are specified, \fB\-\-record\-ids\fR takes precedence.
A special command line type of "all", will indicate all types should
be shown (may be useful for overriding configured defaults).
.TP
\fB\-T\fR "SENSOR-TYPE-LIST", \fB\-\-exclude\-sensor\-types\fR=\fISENSOR\-TYPE\-LIST\fR
Specify sensor types to not show sensor outputs for.  Multiple types
can be eparated by commas or spaces.  A special command line type of
"none", will indicate no types should be excluded (may be useful for
overriding configured defaults).
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-list\-sensor\-types\fR
List sensor types.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-bridge\-sensors\fR
By default, sensors readings are not attempted for sensors on non-BMC
owners.  By setting this option, sensor requests can be bridged to
non-BMC owners to obtain sensor readings (experimental).  Bridging may
not work on some interfaces/driver types.
.TP
\fB\-\-shared\-sensors\fR
Some sensors share the same sensor data record (SDR).  This is
typically utilized for system event log (SEL) entries and not for
sensor readings.  However, there may be some motherboards in which
this format is utilized for multiple active sensors, or the user
simply has interest in seeing the permutation of entries shared by a
SDR entry.  By setting this option, each sensor number shared by a
record will be iterated over and output.
