"assumeio" - This workaround option will assume inband interfaces
communicate with system I/O rather than being memory-mapped.  This
will work around systems that report invalid base addresses.  Those
hitting this issue may see "device not supported" or "could not find
inband device" errors.  Issue observed on HP ProLiant DL145 G1.
