freeipmi (1.0.8-1~pre1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * ipmimonitoring tool was removed -- superseded by ipmi-sensors
    and the new --output-sensor-state option (thin wrapper
    /usr/sbin/ipmimonitoring is provided)
  * Config files were moved under /etc/freeipmi.  Legacy location (under
    /etc) is supported only for backwards compatibility.

freeipmi (0.8.10-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Upstream has switched from CVS to SVN.  Since target SVN seemed to lack any
  history of merging, I had decided to revert to classical way to package for
  Debian based on tarballs.  Thus do not expect complete development history
  upon checkout.  As a consequence I  have abandoned any previous history of
  Debian packaging, and recreated Debian packaging repository use
  git-import-dscs --debsnap.  Please remove any previous debcheckout of
  freeipmi you might have.

  To stay consistent with upstream, following init.d/default/logrotate.d
  files for freeipmi-bmc-watchdog were renamed accordingly (with handling
  of renames done by dpkg-maintscript-helper mv_conffile in debhelper
  scripts).
  Please verify that your changes to corresponding files were preserved.
