freeipmi (0.8.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

 * Upstream has switched from CVS to SVN.  Since target SVN seemed to lack any
   history of merging, I had decided to revert to classical way to package for
   Debian based on tarballs.  Thus do not expect complete development history
   upon checkout.  As a consequence I  have abandoned any previous history of
   Debian packaging, and recreated Debian packaging repository use
   git-import-dscs --debsnap.  Please remove any previous debcheckout of
   freeipmi you might have.
