    - debian/control
      + policy version boost to 3.8.3 from 3.8.0
      + me in maintainer
      + tune up descriptions to my liking
      + added Homepage, Vcs- header fields
      + freeipmi-common to contain common config file + info/man pages
    - debian/copyright
      + list proper copyright holders (not authors)
    - debian/watch -- added
    - debian/*.install -- reverted to install tools under /sbin: nothing
