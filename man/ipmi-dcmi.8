.SH "NAME"
ipmi-dcmi \- IPMI DCMI utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ipmi-dcmi
[\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B Ipmi-dcmi
is used to execute Data Center Manageability Interface (often referred
to as DCM or DCMI) IPMI extension commands. DCMI extensions include
support for asset management and power usage management. Most will be
interested in DCMI for its power management features. By configuring
an exception action, power limit, and correction time limit, power
usage in a data center can be managed more affectively. Please see
\fB\-\-set\-power\-limit\fR option below for more information.

The DCMI specification encompasses many traditional IPMI features that
are not implemented directly in this tool. Please see
.B ipmiconsole(8)
for Serial-over-LAN (SOL) support,
.B ipmi-chassis(8)
for power status, power control, identification, and ACPI power state information,
.B ipmipower(8)
for power status and power control,
.B ipmi-sel(8)
for System Event Log (SEL) information,
.B bmc-info(8)
for device and globally unique ID (guid) information,
.B ipmi-sensors(8)
for sensor readings,
and
.B bmc-config(8)
for configuration.
.LP
Listed below are general IPMI options, tool specific options, trouble
shooting information, workaround information, examples, and known
issues. For a general introduction to FreeIPMI please see

\fB\-\-get\-dcmi\-capability\-info\fR
Get DCMI capability information.
.TP
\fB\-\-get\-asset\-tag\fR
Get asset tag.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-asset\-tag\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Set asset tag.
.TP
\fB\-\-get\-management\-controller\-identifier\-string\fR
Get management controller identifier string tag.
.TP

.TP
\fB\-\-get\-power\-limit\fR
Get power limit information.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-power\-limit\fR
Set power limit configuration. Can specify configuration via
the
\fB\-\-exception\-actions\fR,
\fB\-\-power\-limit\-requested\fR,
\fB\-\-correction\-time\-limit\fR,
and
\fB\-\-correction\-time\-limit\fR
options
listed below. If one or more options below are not specified, current
configuration will be utilized.
.TP
\fB\-\-exception\-actions\fR=\fIBITMASK\fR
Specify exception actions for set power limit configuration. Special
case allowable values: NO_ACTION, HARD_POWER_OFF_SYSTEM,
LOG_EVENT_TO_SEL_ONLY. Other values (e.g. 0x02 through 0x10) are OEM
dependent. Used with the \fB\-\-set\-power\-limit\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-\-power\-limit\-requested\fR=\fIWATTS\fR
Specify power limit for set power limit configuration. Input is
specified in watts. Used with the \fB\-\-set\-power\-limit\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-\-correction\-time\-limit\fR=\fIMILLISECONDS\fR
Specify correction time limit for set power limit configuration.
Input is specified in milliseconds. Used with the
\fB\-\-set\-power\-limit\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-\-statistics\-sampling\-period\fR=\fISECONDS\fR
Specify management application statistics sampling period for set
power limit configuration. Input is specified in seconds. Used with
the \fB\-\-set\-power\-limit\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-\-activate\-deactivate\-power\-limit\fR=\fIOPERATION\fR
Activate or deactivate power limit. Allowed values: ACTIVATE, DEACTIVATE.
.TP
\fB\-\-interpret\-oem\-data\fR
Attempt to interpret OEM data, such as event data, sensor readings, or
general extra info, etc. If an OEM interpretation is not available,
the default output will be generated. Correctness of OEM
interpretations cannot be guaranteed due to potential changes OEM
vendors may make in products, firmware, etc. See OEM INTERPRETATION
below for confirmed supported motherboard interpretations.
.SH "HOSTRANGED OPTIONS"
The following options manipulate hostranged output. See HOSTRANGED
SUPPORT below for additional information on hostranges.
.TP
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-buffer-output\fR
Buffer hostranged output. For each node, buffer standard output until
the node has completed its IPMI operation. When specifying this
option, data may appear to output slower to the user since the the
entire IPMI operation must complete before any data can be output.
See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional information.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-consolidate-output\fR
Consolidate hostranged output. The complete standard output from
every node specified will be consolidated so that nodes with identical
output are not output twice. A header will list those nodes with the
consolidated output. When this option is specified, no output can be
seen until the IPMI operations to all nodes has completed. If the
user breaks out of the program early, all currently consolidated
output will be dumped. See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional
information.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR \fINUM\fR, \fB\-\-fanout\fR=\fINUM\fR
Specify multiple host fanout. A "sliding window" (or fanout)
algorithm is used for parallel IPMI communication so that slower nodes
or timed out nodes will not impede parallel communication. The
maximum number of threads available at the same time is limited by the
fanout. The default is 64.
.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-eliminate\fR
Eliminate hosts determined as undetected by
.B ipmidetect.
This attempts to remove the common issue of hostranged execution
timing out due to several nodes being removed from service in a large
cluster. The
.B ipmidetectd
daemon must be running on the node executing the command.
.TP
\fB\-\-always\-prefix\fR
Always prefix output, even if only one host is specified or
communicating in-band. This option is primarily useful for
scripting purposes. Option will be ignored if specified with
the \fB\-C\fR option.
.SH "HOSTRANGED SUPPORT"
Multiple hosts can be input either as an explicit comma separated
lists of hosts or a range of hostnames in the general form:
prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n < m and l < k, etc. The later form
should not be confused with regular expression character classes (also
denoted by []). For example, foo[19] does not represent foo1 or foo9,
but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.
.LP
This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a
prefixNN naming convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as such,
or by the range foo[1,9].
.LP
Some examples of range usage follow:
.nf
    foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05
    foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10
    foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3
.fi
.LP
As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ([
and ]) for pattern matching. Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.
.LP
When multiple hosts are specified by the user, a thread will be
executed for each host in parallel up to the configured fanout (which
can be adjusted via the \fB\-F\fR option). This will allow
communication to large numbers of nodes far more quickly than if done
in serial.
.LP
By default, standard output from each node specified will be output
with the hostname prepended to each line. Although this output is
readable in many situations, it may be difficult to read in other
situations. For example, output from multiple nodes may be mixed
together. The \fB\-B\fR and \fB\-C\fR options can be used to change
this default.
.LP
In-band IPMI Communication will be used when the host "localhost" is
specified. This allows the user to add the localhost into the
hostranged output.
.SH "GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING"
Most often, IPMI problems are due to configuration problems.
.LP
IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the remote
machine's BMC.  Double check to make sure the following are configured
properly in the remote machine's BMC: IP address, MAC address, subnet
mask, username, user enablement, user privilege, password, LAN
privilege, LAN enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For
IPMI 2.0 connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
.B bmc-config(8)
tool can be used to check and/or change these configuration
settings.
.LP
Inband IPMI problems are typically caused by improperly configured
drivers or non-standard BMCs.
.LP
In addition to the troubleshooting tips below, please see WORKAROUNDS
below to also if there are any vendor specific bugs that have been
discovered and worked around.
.LP
Listed below are many of the common issues for error messages.
For additional support, please e-mail the <freeipmi\-users@gnu.org>
mailing list.
.LP
"username invalid" - The username entered (or a NULL username if none
was entered) is not available on the remote machine. It may also be
possible the remote BMC's username configuration is incorrect.
.LP
"password invalid" - The password entered (or a NULL password if none
was entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the password for
the user is not correctly configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"password verification timeout" - Password verification has timed out.
A "password invalid" error (described above) or a generic "session
timeout" (described below) occurred.  During this point in the
protocol it cannot be differentiated which occurred.
.LP
"k_g invalid" - The K_g key entered (or a NULL K_g key if none was
entered) is not correct. It may also be possible the K_g key is not
correctly configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"privilege level insufficient" - An IPMI command requires a higher
user privilege than the one authenticated with. Please try to
authenticate with a higher privilege. This may require authenticating
to a different user which has a higher maximum privilege.
.LP
"privilege level cannot be obtained for this user" - The privilege
level you are attempting to authenticate with is higher than the
maximum allowed for this user. Please try again with a lower
privilege. It may also be possible the maximum privilege level
allowed for a user is not configured properly on the remote BMC.
.LP
"authentication type unavailable for attempted privilege level" - The
authentication type you wish to authenticate with is not available for
this privilege level. Please try again with an alternate
authentication type or alternate privilege level. It may also be
possible the available authentication types you can authenticate with
are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.
.LP
"cipher suite id unavailable" - The cipher suite id you wish to
authenticate with is not available on the remote BMC. Please try
again with an alternate cipher suite id. It may also be possible the
available cipher suite ids are not correctly configured on the remote
BMC.
.LP
"ipmi 2.0 unavailable" - IPMI 2.0 was not discovered on the remote
machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5 instead.
.LP
"connection timeout" - Initial IPMI communication failed. A number of
potential errors are possible, including an invalid hostname
specified, an IPMI IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled
on the remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please
verify configuration and connectivity.
.LP
"session timeout" - The IPMI session has timed out. Please reconnect.
If this error occurs often, you may wish to increase the
retransmission timeout. Some remote BMCs are considerably slower than
others.
.LP
"device not found" - The specified device could not be found. Please
check configuration or inputs and try again.
.LP
"driver timeout" - Communication with the driver or device has timed
out. Please try again.
.LP
"message timeout" - Communication with the driver or device has timed
out. Please try again.
.LP
"BMC busy" - The BMC is currently busy. It may be processing
information or have too many simultaneous sessions to manage. Please
wait and try again.
.LP
"could not find inband device" - An inband device could not be found.
Please check configuration or specify specific device or driver on the
command line.
.LP
"driver timeout" - The inband driver has timed out communicating to
the local BMC or service processor. The BMC or service processor may
be busy or (worst case) possibly non-functioning.
.SH "WORKAROUNDS"
With so many different vendors implementing their own IPMI solutions,
different vendors may implement their IPMI protocols incorrectly. The
following describes a number of workarounds currently available to
handle discovered compliance issues. When possible, workarounds have
been implemented so they will be transparent to the user. However,
some will require the user to specify a workaround be used via the -W
option.
.LP
The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware that a
problem was discovered on. Newer versions of hardware may fix the
problems indicated below. Similar machines from vendors may or may
not exhibit the same problems. Different vendors may license their
firmware from the same IPMI firmware developer, so it may be
worthwhile to try workarounds listed below even if your motherboard is
not listed.
.LP
If you believe your hardware has an additional compliance issue that
needs a workaround to be implemented, please contact the FreeIPMI
maintainers on <freeipmi\-users@gnu.org> or <freeipmi\-devel@gnu.org>.
.LP
\fIassumeio\fR - This workaround flag will assume inband interfaces
communicate with system I/O rather than being memory-mapped. This
will work around systems that report invalid base addresses. Those
hitting this issue may see "device not supported" or "could not find
inband device" errors.  Issue observed on HP ProLiant DL145 G1.
.LP
\fIspinpoll\fR - This workaround flag will inform some inband drivers
(most notably the KCS driver) to spin while polling rather than
putting the process to sleep. This may significantly improve the wall
clock running time of tools because an operating system scheduler's
granularity may be much larger than the time it takes to perform a
single IPMI message transaction. However, by spinning, your system
may be performing less useful work by not contexting out the tool for
a more useful task.
.LP
\fIauthcap\fR - This workaround flag will skip early checks for username
capabilities, authentication capabilities, and K_g support and allow
IPMI authentication to succeed. It works around multiple issues in
which the remote system does not properly report username
capabilities, authentication capabilities, or K_g status. Those
hitting this issue may see "username invalid", "authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level", or "k_g invalid" errors.
Issue observed on Asus P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML,
and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.
.LP
\fIidzero\fR - This workaround flag will allow empty session IDs to be
accepted by the client. It works around IPMI sessions that report
empty session IDs to the client. Those hitting this issue may see
"session timeout" errors. Issue observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289
BMC.
.LP
\fIunexpectedauth\fR - This workaround flag will allow unexpected non-null
authcodes to be checked as though they were expected. It works around
an issue when packets contain non-null authentication data when they
should be null due to disabled per-message authentication. Those
hitting this issue may see "session timeout" errors. Issue observed
on Dell PowerEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on newer firmware.
.LP
\fIforcepermsg\fR - This workaround flag will force per-message
authentication to be used no matter what is advertised by the remote
system. It works around an issue when per-message authentication is
advertised as disabled on the remote system, but it is actually
required for the protocol. Those hitting this issue may see "session
timeout" errors.  Issue observed on IBM eServer 325.
.LP
\fIendianseq\fR - This workaround flag will flip the endian of the session
sequence numbers to allow the session to continue properly. It works
around IPMI 1.5 session sequence numbers that are the wrong endian.
Those hitting this issue may see "session timeout" errors. Issue
observed on some Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor
endian).
.LP
\fIintel20\fR - This workaround flag will work around several Intel IPMI
2.0 authentication issues. The issues covered include padding of
usernames, and password truncation if the authentication algorithm is
HMAC-MD5-128. Those hitting this issue may see "username invalid",
"password invalid", or "k_g invalid" errors. Issue observed on Intel
SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition).
.LP
\fIsupermicro20\fR - This workaround flag will work around several
Supermicro IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on motherboards w/ Peppercon
IPMI firmware. The issues covered include handling invalid length
authentication codes. Those hitting this issue may see "password
invalid" errors.  Issue observed on Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO
daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver firmware.
.LP
\fIsun20\fR - This workaround flag will work work around several Sun IPMI
2.0 authentication issues. The issues covered include invalid
lengthed hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite
records. Those hitting this issue may see "password invalid" or "bmc
error" errors.  Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.
This workaround automatically includes the "opensesspriv" workaround.
.LP
\fIopensesspriv\fR - This workaround flag will slightly alter
FreeIPMI's IPMI 2.0 connection protocol to workaround an invalid
hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The privilege level sent
during the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0 connection is used for
hashing keys instead of the privilege level sent during the RAKP1
connection stage. Those hitting this issue may see "password
invalid", "k_g invalid", or "bad rmcpplus status code" errors.  Issue
observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell
Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and Quanta QSSC-S4R//Appro
GB812X-CN. This workaround is automatically triggered with the
"sun20" workaround.
.LP
\fIintegritycheckvalue\fR - This workaround flag will work around an
invalid integrity check value during an IPMI 2.0 session establishment
when using Cipher Suite ID 0. The integrity check value should be 0
length, however the remote motherboard responds with a non-empty
field. Those hitting this issue may see "k_g invalid" errors. Issue
observed on Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel
S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700.
.LP
No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some motherboards that support IPMI 2.0 have
been found to not support IPMI 1.5. Those hitting this issue may see
"ipmi 2.0 unavailable" or "connection timeout" errors. This issue can
be worked around by using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by specifying
\fB\-\-driver\-address\fR=\fILAN_2_0\fR. Issue observed on HP
Proliant DL 145.
.SH "OEM INTERPRETATION"
The following motherboards are confirmed to have atleast some support
by the \fB\-\-interpret-oem-data\fR option. While highly probable the
OEM data interpretations would work across other motherboards by the
same manufacturer, there are no guarantees. Some of the motherboards
below may be rebranded by vendors/distributors.

.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
On older operating systems, if you input your username, password,
and other potentially security relevant information on the command
line, this information may be discovered by other users when using
tools like the
.B ps(1)
command or looking in the /proc file system. It is generally more
secure to input password information with options like the -P or -K
options. Configuring security relevant information in the FreeIPMI
configuration file would also be an appropriate way to hide this information.
.LP
In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will temporarily
"lock up" after a number of remote authentication errors. You may
need to wait awhile in order to this temporary "lock up" to pass
before you may authenticate again.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
